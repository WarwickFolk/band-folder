Tuesday of week 1 is the Feast of Saint George / St George’s Day according to the Gregorian calendar, 
as we all know since St George is the patron saint of England. 
He's also the patron saint of quite a few countries in the near East like Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and Syria too! 
Since the day is observed by all the Christian churches, 
and there’s lots of folk songs from Eastern Europe that celebrate St George's Day and the coming of spring as well, 
as it used to coincide with the festival of Ederlezi/Hıdrellez.

Ederlezi/Hıdrellez (dephending which langauge/religion you prefer to align wit) is a folk holiday from Eastern Europe and the Balkans 
(I believe originating in Turkic paganism) which celebrates the coming of spring 
(or if you’re Muslim, the meeting of prophets Hızır and Ilyas on Earth as well). 
This is celebrated on May 5-6th (April 23rd in the Julian calendar, hence the mention of it coinciding with St George’s in the west).
